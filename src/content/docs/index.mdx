## About Us

The Summerside Community Choir is an open membership, mixed-voice community choir who welcomes new members at the beginning of each term to work towards an end-of-term concert. We perform two Christmas concerts in December and two spring concerts in May or June and may have extra events throughout the term.

In 1978, Bill Leuty had a dream to start a community choir in Summerside, PEI, Canada. He was able to make this dream a reality, and in 2018 the 50-plus member Summerside Community Choir celebrated forty years of choral music.

## Join the choir

We welcome new members for the first three weeks of rehearsals at the beginning of each term in September and January. There is no formal audition process for new members. Those who wish to join as a new singer can simply show up to the first rehearsal, at which point music will be distributed to all singers and you will choose your voice part (Soprano, 2nd Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Baritone, Bass). You are welcome to contact us ahead of time with questions, and we encourage a note just to let us know you might be coming so you'll get all the same pre-term prep info and notifications as our registered members, but it's not required.

All new members will be automatically accepted on a trial basis for a probationary period of approximately one month. This is to ensure that you and the choir are a good fit for each other. You will not be required to formally audition, but our Director may choose to meet with you privately to discuss your fit with the choir, or within your vocal section. This may include listening to your voice privately.

We welcome dedicated, enthusiastic singers of all experience levels to start at the beginning of a new term. Although we are an unauditioned choir, it should be noted that our choral arrangements are challenging and will require personal practice outside of rehearsals to learn notes, as well as the ability to carry a tune, sing in harmony and blend with the group. We also have a strict attendance policy, so commitment to weekly rehearsals and keeping up with any assigned “homework” is important. All choir members will receive a copy of our full policies and member responsibilities at the beginning of each term.

Previous choral experience is an asset, and is expected, but not absolutely required. It is assumed (but again, not required) that you know your voice type and which vocal section you wish to join.

If you have never sung choir pieces in four-part (SATB) harmony before, we do recommend that you show up early before practice or contact our Director ahead of time so that you can be placed in a vocal section. More information about choosing a vocal part can be found in articles such as [What Is My Voice Type](https://www.musicalbri.com/what-is-my-voice-type/)?

If you have any questions about joining the choir, please feel free to contact us.

### Rehearsal Info

Rehearsals are held weekly, Tuesday nights from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the [Summerside Presbyterian Church](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EBJVvn8Ef3TC6oZN7).

Please show up early enough that you are in your seat and ready to start warm-ups at 7:00 p.m. sharp!

Please bring a pencil and eraser for making (temporary) notes on your music but NO pens or highlighters! Please also bring a binder or sturdy folder to protect the music you'll receive. Feel free to bring a water bottle, to keep you hydrated.

### Community Service Bursary for PEI high school students

The Summerside Community Choir is a registered organization participating in the [Community Service Bursary Program](https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/education-and-lifelong-learning/community-service-bursary). Grade 11 and 12 students may count up to 100 hours singing with the choir (at a rate of $5/hour) towards a post-secondary bursary.
